# eCommerce Website

I created this project to practice Angular and Springboot development. The project leverages a Java Spring Boot back end to handle business logic, user authentication, and data processing, while the Angular front end ensures a smooth and responsive user experience. The site features a product catalog, shopping cart, and secure checkout process.
